Fun Calculator 🎉
Welcome to the Fun Calculator! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style and a touch of humor. 😎

Features ✨
➕ Addition: Adds two numbers

➖ Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first

✖️ Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers

➗ Division: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 😅)

How to Use 🚀
Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).

Enter the first number when prompted.

Enter the second number when prompted.

Enjoy the results of all four operations displayed in a fun format! 🎉

Example Usage 💻
bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
Notes ⚠️
The calculator uses float inputs, so both whole numbers and decimals are supported.

No error handling for division by zero is included (yet!) - so be responsible with your math! 😜

Future Improvements 🔮
Add input validation

Include error handling for division by zero

Add more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)

Create a GUI version
